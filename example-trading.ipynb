    "### Why standard backtest code is bad\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way of writing backtest typically involves functions, manually caching data in pickle files and parameters all over the place. This is bad because:\n",
    "* Have to manually track functions, parameters, files\n",
    "* Doesn't scale well as you add complexity\n",
    "* Cumbersome to compare output of different models/parameters\n",
    "* Difficult for others to read and audit\n",
    "* Costly to productionize\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rapid prototyping with d6tflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing functions, quantitative investing code is better written as a set of tasks with dependencies between them. That is your workflow should be a DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of doings this are:\n",
    "* Easily define tasks with dependencies and parameters\n",
    "* Intelligently run workflow with dependencies/parameters\n",
    "* Easily compare results of different models/parameters\n",
    "* Lightweight and quick to learn yet powerful\n",
    "* Code scales well and is easy to audit\n",
